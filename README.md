# Beating MC Race Event | An Event hosted by me, SylvesterNumski

This is the GitHub with all the code of the plugin I'm currently developing for a minecraft event I'm working on. 

I'm fine with anyone using any of this code for their own projects as long as they steal my code, don't make any changes, and claim it as their own. Of course, I won't press any legal charges since I'm just a guy messing around and want to make an event but still please don't steal my code without giving me credit.

Speaking of credit, I'd like to give thanks to TheDeafCreeper for helping me out with a lot of this code. He's taught me a lot about kotlin and has helped me with troubleshooting. 

If you'd like to join this event or any of my future events you can join my discord server where I announce events I make and post sneak peeks for events in development.
